Welcome! I’m Tong, a computational science and engineering graduate with a deep curiosity about how technology shapes society. I am particularly interested in topics like censorship, misinformation as a form of control, the act of harvesting and hoarding information to gain power, as well as value-laden technology. I’m also open to a mixture of both quantitative and qualitative methods, for example using agent-based modeling to explore how authorities influence public opinion through citizens’ self-censorship.
